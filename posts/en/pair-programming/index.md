You might doubt the efficiency of pair programming or mob programming. I have done it through 1 year. I would like to share my hands-on experience with you.

## Mob programming was the hell

My team wrote program in a meating room. We always saw the same monitor and talked how design should be. If we need to research about something, we googled togather. But to me, **it was very stressfull**.

My co-workers shouted and argued each other almost everyday. One of my co-worker was always irritate, another co-worker got suffered from mental illness. 

The problem was that my team did mob programming a whole day and everyday. **Do not do that**. It might distroy your mental.

The efficiency was improved? I can not tell you since my team stopped the project which we developped at the time.

Anyway, I felt mob programming like the hell. Of course, there is a bright side in mob. Let me tell you.

### Mob style is very efficient for googling and debugging

My team does not do mob or pair programming anymore because it was very stressfull. But I have to admit to solve the problem with co-workers, **it is very efficient**.

For example, if I encountered a bug and not sure what is the root cause. I always talked to my co-workers. Sometimes, I found the root cause during explaining the problem to my co-worker even though my co-worker did not tell anything.

If you interrupt your co-workers, your co-workers might feel uncomfortable. So, you should create nice atmosphere to ask co-workers. It is a bit difficult for some teams, but still worth to do it for productivity.

I agree with mob style solving problem is very efficient.


## Pair programming was stressfull

To me, it was stressfull as well. The problem was that we did pair programming a whole day and everyday. Also, it was not fun at all.

I know some companies do pair programming, but I do not agree with pair programming. If a pair have experience more than you, you might need to follow an order all the time. Your pair might have a sharp tongue. Your pair might have bad breath or body order. It will be very stressfull, right?

Of course, you do not need to review program if you do pair programming. Yes, I agree with that. But the stress is more than that.

I felt so much stress. Pair programing is okay sometimes, but not all the time.
