description: How to set original URL

If you don't set custom domain, the URL will be something like https://amazing-nobel-819f94.netlify.app. You can use original domain name. I am going to tell you how to do it.

First of all, you need to buy a domain name. I found a clouple of sites for buying domain.

- [GoDaddy](https://sg.godaddy.com/offers/domains/godaddy-domains?isc=gofkgjp01&countryview=1&currencyType=jpy&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6ar4BRDnARIsAITGzlAKaaPMdXp48GZKQZtvfRbYBqlWYtljjLA4rz-cAbGd6liCPdPRhlcaAtLAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
- [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/)

Of course, you can buy a domain in the other web site.

## Adding custom domain to Netlify

Click Add custom domain.

![adding](./adding-custom-domain.jpg)

Click verify. If you can use the domain, it will be passed.

![custom-domain-list](./custom-domain-list.jpg)

If you click Check DNS configuration, you can see the below dialog.

You need to set Primary domain and Redirects automatically to primary domain both.

## How to set DNS record?

You should check a website where you bought your domain. You should be able to register A/CNAME records there. If you are not sure, you should ask to the company.

### Let's check dig command

After registering A/CNAME records, you can check if the registeration is done by dig command.

```bash
dig please-enter-your-domain-name
```

Since DNS takes a time to spread records to all around the world, it might take a time.

Also, you can check by [DNS Propagation Check](https://dnspropagation.net/). Please wait for a while. It might take a day or more. After that, you should be able to see your website by your original URL.
